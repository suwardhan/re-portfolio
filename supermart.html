		<h2>Project overview</h2>
		<p>India is the sixth-largest grocery market globally and one of the fastest-growing markets for online groceries. Online grocery is expected to be one of the fastest gr­o­wing categories reaching $5 billion in 2020 from $1 billion in 2017, as RedSeer Consulting reported, market research and advisory firm. The online groceries sector is a key battleground for online retailers because of the high order volumes and repeats purchases of groceries by customers.</p>
		<p>Flipkart, India’s leading e-commerce marketplace, launched ‘Flipkart Supermart’; its online grocery store for Bangalore customers, in 2017 on its mobile app and website. This category is gradually scaling in other cities across India as well.</p>
		
		<p>The study aims to understand <strong>users’ grocery buying processes</strong> and <strong>evaluate the usability aspects </strong> of the mobile app and desktop designs.</p>
		<p><strong>Team members:</strong> 2 Designers & 2 Product managers
		<br><strong>My role:</strong> User researcher</p>
		
		<p class="italic-text p-small">To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information in this case study. All information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Flipkart.</p>

		<br><br>
		<h2>Research overview</h2>
		<p>Before devising the methodology and designing tasks, it was important for me to understand the Supermart category performance in Bangalore. I studied the metrics with a data analyst who gave me a walkthrough of the problems observed during the quantitative analysis. The analysis helped me decide the tasks and focus areas in the online grocery shopping journey.</p>

		<h3>Research objectives</h3>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>To gain an understanding of users’ grocery ordering process.</li>
			<li>Evaluate and gather insights around the usability of different touchpoints in the shopping journey:</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="div-container">
		<ul>
			<li>Gather an understanding of users’ comprehension, perceptions, and preferences while interacting with Flipkart grocery.</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		<p>After finalizing on research objectives, an end-to-end usability evaluation of the online grocery experience was decided with 12 participants (8 mobile app users and 4 desktop users) which comprised of :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Interview sessions with each participant (60–90 minutes), which included: a short briefing, a pre-shopping interview, and a think-aloud task* on a test phone/laptop.</li>
			<li>A 10–15 minutes telephonic interview on post-order experience was conducted after the participant received the order.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Task*:</strong> Users were asked to buy bi-weekly/monthly groceries for themselves from Flipkart. Users went through the entire flow: Search or browse → a selection of items → order → payment → order confirmation. A gift voucher worth 1500 INR was provided to order items on the supermart platform.</p>
		<h3>Participant recruitment</h3>
		<p>Our participants were recruited from 2 cohorts: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Flipkart regular grocery shoppers</li>
			<li>Other app grocery shoppers — Amazon, Big Basket, Grofers.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>These participants were recruited with the help of an agency. A recruiting screener was shared with the vendor agency, which can get a list of potential participants, sift through the responses, schedule appropriate participants, and manage their compensation for us.</p>

		<br><br>
		<h2>Data analysis</h2>
		<p>I started the analysis in the following steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>After each session, I scheduled <strong>debriefing sessions</strong> with the designers and product managers. Each member has to share their notes with the group of what they observed in the sessions.</li>
			<li>Next, I watched the <strong>session recordings</strong> and went through the transcripts based on the interview protocol to make notes of whatever we missed in our debriefing discussions.</li>
			<li>Finally, I examined the notes to <strong>find patterns and coded them</strong>. I divided the whole shopping journey into three phases: Basket building, Ordering, and post order. Using the clusters, insights were generated in the shopping journey, and opportunities were created.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I included supporting video clips and quotations while assembling the report.</p>

		<h3>Business impact</h3>
		<p>The recommendations led to design changes, feature concept changes and contributed to the <strong>product roadmap, </strong> providing opportunities for new features in the grocery category.</p>
		<p>Flipkart further <strong>launched</strong> this grocery category ‘Supermart’ <strong>in 4 more cities </strong> across India (Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai).</p>
		<p><strong>The design changes lead to an increase in total conversion by an ambitious 120bps.</strong></p>
