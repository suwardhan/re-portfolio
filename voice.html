		<h2>Project overview</h2>
		<p>Voice-based interface for home automation, entertainment, and shopping has become a strategic battleground among technology rivals like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung worldwide.</p>
		<p>It was estimated that there would be 24.5 million voice-first devices shipped in 2017, which led to a total device footprint of 33 million devices in circulation that year.</p>
		<p>Further, 28% of search queries in India are made by voice on Google. Moreover, Hindi voice search queries are growing at over 400% year on year. Google Assistant also witnessed six-fold growth in its usage with the launch of the Jio phone in India.
		</p>
		<p>Observing the above trends in voice, <strong>Flipkart</strong> was keen to understand -</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How users use Smart devices (Google Home/Amazon Echo) in India.</li>
			<li>How Flipkart can leverage voice features in the shopping journey.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Research objectives</h2>
		<p>After the secondary research, we drilled down to the below objectives for the research:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Understand behaviors and frictions related to Smart device usage and the role of devices in users’ lives.</li>
			<li>Identify what tasks are considered fit for Smart devices for the tech-savvy cohort.</li>
			<li>Gather thoughts about doing shopping, using smart devices.</li>
			<li>Identify categories and use cases considered fit for smart devices.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="p-small" >This was phase III of the voice next 100 million Study. Phase I and II were conducted before this in Flipkart.</p>
		<h3>Participant criteria</h3>
		<p>After discussions with the team and analyzing the secondary research, we decided on the study's participant criteria. The smart device usage was high in India's metro cities, and we defined these users as Tech-savvy users. Other criteria considered for the participants were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Owns at least one of the following devices (Google Home, Google Home Mini, Amazon Echo/echo plus, Amazon Echo dot) and active user of the same.</li>
			<li>The age group considered was 25–35 years as smart devices usage was high among this age group in India.</li>
			<li>The smart devices' language was English in 2017, and therefore, fluent English speakers were considered.</li>
			<li>Participants should be online shoppers, and they are medium to high user of commerce apps, which means that they must have shopped at least three times on any e-commerce in the last 1 year.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Research method</h2>
		<p>To deep dive into the users' life of using smart devices, the research method was <strong>In-depth Interviews.</strong> The study took place with <strong>12 participants</strong> in their homes, and we spent 1.5 hours with each participant in <strong>Delhi</strong> and <strong>Pune</strong> cities.</p>
		<h3>Interview protocol</h3>
		<p>I took a funnel approach for my discussion guide, where it begins broadly and progressively narrows the topic area to the subject matter of greatest importance to the research objectives.</p>

		<p class="image-caption">Study structure — Funnel approach</p>
		<p><strong>Stage 1</strong> - Introduction: I introduced myself to the participant, briefly explained the purpose of the research, the use of audio/video recording, participant’s anonymity, etc., and allowed the participant(s) to ask questions.</p>
		<p><strong>Stage 2</strong> - Phone, apps usage, and Smart devices: General information and background related to participants’ phones and smart devices were gathered at this stage.</p>
		<p><strong>Stage 3</strong> - Smart device usage: Attitudes and behaviors related to smart device usage were observed. The main tasks were performed on the participants' smart devices, and the extent of awareness about the smart device was captured.</p>
		<p><strong>Stage 4</strong> - Smart device and Shopping along with shopping on Flipkart: Attitudes specific to shopping using smart devices using stimuli cards were captured. Finally, their expectation and suggestions related to the shopping using voice for Flipkart shopping was gathered.</p>

		<h2>Analysis</h2>
		<p>I analyzed the transcripts to find out patterns and themes. I collated a detailed insights report with video clippings and quotations to present to all stakeholders (Product, design, business, tech, and marketing teams).</p>
		<p>The insights were compared to the first two phases of the study, which was done with less tech-savvy and moderately tech-savvy users.</p>
		<p>The insights served as an input to product direction to approach these different cohort users.</p>

		<h3>Impact</h3>
		<p>The research insights served as an input to <strong>product strategy.</strong></p>
		<p>The team took the direction of the <strong>multimodal interface</strong> and not smart devices for shopping use cases.</p>
		<p>All phases of the study helped identify the <strong>different cohorts</strong> of users, and based on insights, different concepts with shopping use cases were designed.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Following work:</h2>
		<p><strong>Part I:</strong> I conducted a research study to test the proposed concept with one category use cases and three cohorts of target users. This was a concept reaction to study the stimuli, which consisted of the product hypothesis and assumptions.</p>
		<p><strong>Part II:</strong> In addition to the concept study, I did a usability evaluation with the app using retrospective think-aloud to assess the usability aspects of the app.</p>
