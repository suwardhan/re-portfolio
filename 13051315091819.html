		<h2>Project overview</h2>
		<p>People living away from their friends and families in places with cultural and linguistic barriers suffer pangs of social isolation. Research studies have shown that emotional memories help these people adapt better to these unfamiliar environments. This project presents Memoirs, a mobile application that fulfills the emotional needs of these people by facilitating them to relive the memories associated with objects of high emotional value.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>First runner-up in OzCHI 2015, <i>International Student Design Challenge, Melbourne, Australia</i></p>
		<br>
		<p>Role: User Research, Conceptualization, Prototyping, and Concept video</p>
		<p>Duration: 24 hours</p>
		<p>Team members: Samadrita Das, Dipti Kumari, and Deepika Mittal</p>
		<br>
		<h2>The Challenge:  Beating social isolation</h2>
		<p>“Increasing real world interaction and social connectivity for socially isolated people.” </p>
		<p>Research has consistently identified that there is a link between social contact and improved wellbeing. Social isolation can be a risk factor for people’s mental and physical health. Reducing social isolation by improving social contact has been shown to reduce incidence of depression and, in some studies, to improve participants’ physical health as well. Greaves and Farbus (2006) suggest that “interventions which promote active rather than passive social contact, are more likely to impact positively on health and quality of life.”</p>
		<p>Our challenge was to create a design that will increase real world interaction and social connectivity for socially isolated people at 24-hour International Student Design Challenge at OzCHI. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Design Process </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>We identified people living away from their homes as the final target group during the brainstorming session.</li>
			<li>Thereafter, we conducted interviews with 8 adults, 5 males and 3 females belonging to age group 20 to 23 years who stayed in foreign countries for a span of two or more than two months. Each interview lasted between twelve to fifteen minutes.</li>
			<li>The findings from the interviews were analyzed through affinity mapping to identify the crucial pain points which included the inability to adapt to the new surroundings, loneliness, and homesickness.</li>
			<li>Consequently, persona was defined and a scenario was created (as shown in the concept video) to define the primary touch points between the persona and the system, a mobile application.</li>
			<li>A medium-fidelity prototype was then created to depict possible interactions of the user with the application.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h2>Prototype</h2>
		<h3>01. Create a Memoir</h3>
		<p>The user is prompted to add an object from his surroundings to attach memories to this object. He needs to click a picture of the object. This creates a memoir. The user can either save it as a new memoir or add it to an existing memoir.</p>

	<div class="div-container">
		<h3>02. Give details to your memoir</h3>
		<p>The user is asked to give name and event to the memoir. This is to associate the memoir to a memory related to someone special for him and a particular event.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="div-container">
		<h3>03. Add memories to the memoir</h3>
		<p>By attaching photos and recordings videos of the one the user wants the memoir to associate to, the user can add as many memories as he wants.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="div-container">
		<h3>04. Relive your memories</h3>
		<p>When the user feels isolated, he can relive the memories he created by hovering his phone over his memoir. As soon as the memoir is detected, the memories are augmented into the reality of the user simulating the presence of his loved ones.</p>

		<h2>Future Work</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>This concept can be further extended to include artificial intelligence wherein the virtual figure can also emotionally interact and talk to the user real-time exactly like their loved one would have.</li>
			<li>The behavior of this virtual figure can be defined based on the telephonic conversations, personal messages, and their social networking profiles.</li>
			<li>Such an extension of this proposed application might help in tackling the social isolation of people living away from their loved ones.</li>
